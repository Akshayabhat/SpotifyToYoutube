# SpotifyToYoutube
A web app to convert Spotify playlists to Youtube playlists (JAVA)

I used JSP and Java Servlets to implement Oauth 2.0 and authorize the apps. 

<b> SPOTIFY: </b>
Sent requests to the Spotify API to display the user's playlists so he can choose which playlists he wants to export to YouTube. Read the tracks from these playlists 
and stored them in a simple arraylist.

<b> YOUTUBE: </b>
Created YouTube playlists in the user's channel.
Searched for the tracks in YouTube using Track name + artist name. Got the first result and uploaded them onto the playlist.

<b> FUTURE WORK: </b>

1. CSS
2. Use a better metric for searching the tracks - include publisher name/number of likes/views in order to get more relevant 
results
3. Refactor code.
